The testing quality is enhanced through continuous improvement and accumulated testing experience. In the initial test program, we directly poured impurity particles into the test tube for testing, but later found that the error of this program is very large because impurity particles may partially float on the surface of the liquid and are not detected. In the subsequent experiments, we cleaned the particles with a hydrophobic agent and then added liquid to remove oil stains. No bubbles or surface tension of the liquid were generated on the surface of the particles, which improved the measurement accuracy. Nuclide activity ranged from 400 μCi to 1 mCi.

The level of nuclide liquid was higher than the detection angle range of the sensor to ensure that the level of liquid would not affect the detection whether impurities were added.

The methods currently used in the paper are mostly electrical capacitance tomography technology and electromagnetic analysis technology. Wenbo Ma of Tianjin University used a tomography technology based on capacitance-sensitive mechanism to display the physical distribution of multiple streams as images by detecting the changes in the capacitance of the array electrodes and reconstructing the image, constructing the image of each phase of the pipeline15. The distribution image can be used to measure the impurity content inside the pipeline. However, this method is only suitable for the detection of metal particles with a large particle size and cannot achieve accurate online detection of fine particles in the pipeline. Li Bin of the Civil Aviation University of China proposed a method for detecting impurities using the internal magnetic field of metals16. The fluctuating voltage of the sensor when the particles pass by is measured. When the millimeter particles pass by the sensor, the current source can be used as the excitation sensor system to output a more ideal useful signal to realize the measurement of impurities. However, this method places the sensor inside the pipeline for detection, and has a higher requirement on the state of the pipeline. When the liquid in the pipeline is in a state of high temperature and high pressure, the magnetic field is greatly disturbed, and this method fails. The method of using positrons for NDT proposed in this paper can address these shortcomings, and directly perform online detection of the impurity content inside the metal pipe outside the pipe.",0.9285714285714286,11.0,11.0,0,1,1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,273,wehavereadseveralpapersandfindingamethodfordetecti
