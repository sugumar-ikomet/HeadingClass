However, detection means and technology for the detection of impurity contents in liquids under relatively harsh environment still need to be improved4. During aeroengine operation, faults caused by the wear of moving parts, such as front axle bearing, rear axle bearing, and scavenging oil pump, occasionally occur; the wear of key parts accounts for a large proportion5. The wear of components will produce metal impurities. When impurities enter the lubricating oil and accumulate to a certain extent, they will cause failures such as blockage of the pipeline, which will greatly affect the operating state of the engine. Thus, lubricating oil metal content detection is a part of aircraft engine state detection. When the assembled engine is tested on the test bed, impurities in the oil online must be detected. Oil pipes are made of metal because they need to withstand high temperatures and pressures, and detecting the condition inside metal pipes is very difficult6. Since the 1980s, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries have developed a metal debris analysis device for aircraft oil filter to address the metal fragments and abnormal wear failure of aircraft engines7. In the past 50years, atomic emission spectrometry, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, SEM-X-ray energy spectrum analysis, and other methods have been widely used8. However, the radiation generated by X-rays is excessively harmful to the human body and not suitable for long-term detection. In addition, the content of metal (iron, silver, and aluminum) in the lubricating oil can be obtained through the spectral analysis of lubricating oil by using the atomic emission spectrometry of rotating disk electrode9. However, this detection technology has several limitations, such as difficulty in achieving in situ or online measurement and in satisfying the requirements of failure judgment and wear degree prediction of abnormal engine wear. At present, online NDT of oil impurities inside pipelines remains a problem.",p,325,ParaText,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,missing,11.0,11.0,0,1980,span,ParaText,missing,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,"In many industrial applications, impurities in liquids need to be detected.",4,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.023,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Paratext,Paratext,140,2,0,75,1,0,missing,missing,p,p,missing,span,Paratext,Paratext,missing,Paratext,1.0,5.0,90.0,171.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,ParaText,0.9992124

The application of positron annihilation technology has a history of more than 20years, and it plays an increasingly important role in materials science, medicine, and biochemical testing, but its application in the field of NDT remains relatively small. Positron annihilation is a process in which positive and negative electrons meet and disappear together, thereby releasing γ photons. γ photons can pass through metal plates of a certain thickness and obtain the state information inside the materials because of their strong penetrating force; this characteristic can be used to detect liquid impurity content in metal pipelines12.

Gamma photons have high energy and can penetrate high-density materials such as metals and composite materials. If the sensor can record the number of events of gamma photons emitted per unit time and volume (also called the activity of positrons), it can more accurately present the internal state of the measured object. Positron nuclide solution is injected into the pipeline and mixed thoroughly. If impurities exist inside the pipeline, the number of events of gamma photons that can be recorded by the sensor is smaller than that without impurities due to the volume occupied by impurities and the scattering effect of impurities on the gamma photons. This method can achieve the purpose of impurity content detection. Positron nuclide with a certain activity A is injected into the pipeline and mixed thoroughly.

The apparatus included a detecting pipeline assembly and a γ photon detecting apparatus. The detection pipeline assembly consisted of an access pipeline, an experimental branch, a reference branch, and an outgoing pipeline. During the detection of the device, the radionuclide soluble in lubricating oil with a certain activity was completely mixed with engine lubricating oil and injected into the detection pipeline assembly. The number of γ photon response lines in the experimental branch of γ photon detection device was compared with that in the branch, and data processing was carried out to obtain the content of impurities in the pipeline. The reference branch in the device was designed as a reference for measurement. The experimental and reference branches should be made of the same materials, and the oil flowing through the branch should be free from impurities. Thus, a filter screen was added at the entrance of the reference branch road to block particles. The angle of filter screen allowed the flowing lubricating oil to remove the particles deposited near the filter for ensuring the smooth flow of lubricating oil without impurities through the branch road.",p,207,ParaText,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,missing,11.0,11.0,0,Figure 2,span,FigureCallout,missing,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,The schematic of the measurement device for impurities in the engine pipeline based on positron annihilation is shown in Figure 2.,4,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.028,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Paratext,others,140,2,0,130,0,0,missing,missing,p,p,missing,span,Paratext,Paratext,missing,others,1.0,3.0,7.0,110.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,ParaText,0.99935037

In general, substances that satisfy CnH2n+2 can be labeled. An aqueous solution is used for the liquid, that is, CnH2n+2. The impurities in the experiment were aluminum alloy particles with sizes of 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2mm. The sensor used in the experiment was Si-BDM 2550 E, which adopts an LYSO/SiPM probe compatible with a magnetic field, realizes direct digitization of flicker pulse formed after γ photon energy deposition, and can directly output the digital flicker pulse corresponding to the energy deposition event. The sensor was composed of 36 crystal bars, thereby forming a square matrix of 6 × 6. The outer diameter of the sensor was 22mm × 22mm × 35mm. In the experiment, two test tubes were used to replace the symmetrical tube shown in Figure 2. The height of the cylinder part of the test tube was 160mm, and the inner diameter was 24mm. The two test tubes were used for comparison of the test data. The two sensors were placed parallel to the test tube during the experiment to ensure the same effective volume, and a lead block was placed above the sensor to isolate the positive electrons emitted from the slanted upper part. The height of the liquid column was considerably higher than that of the sensor to avoid errors caused by the different heights of the liquid column. Approximately 40ml of nuclides was injected into each tube. The activity was 200 μCi, and the injected nuclide liquid was higher than the lead plate, as shown in Figure 4. Although the liquid column height of two sensors was not exactly the same in this manner, this condition would not lead to the deviation of sensor detection. Figure 4 shows a photo of the experiment site. A metal shell was placed on the test tube to detect the content of impurities to simulate the true internal state of the engine.

Numbers experiments were carried out. The experimental results show that the installation location of sensors, shielding between sensors, and the calculation method of sensor events influence the detection results. The uniform distribution of particles in the pipeline is also a problem to be considered in the experiment. The testing quality is enhanced through continuous improvement and accumulated testing experience. In the initial test program, we directly poured impurity particles into the test tube for testing, but later found that the error of this program is very large because impurity particles may partially float on the surface of the liquid and are not detected. In the subsequent experiments, we cleaned the particles with a hydrophobic agent and then added liquid to remove oil stains. No bubbles or surface tension of the liquid were generated on the surface of the particles, which improved the measurement accuracy. Nuclide activity ranged from 400 μCi to 1 mCi. During the experiment, two measuring cylinders were used to replace the double-tube structure shown in Figure 2, and nuclides with the same activity were added. The level of nuclide liquid was higher than the detection angle range of the sensor to ensure that the level of liquid would not affect the detection whether impurities were added. Volume can be obtained from the density and weight. The accurate weight of particulate matters can be easily obtained compared with the accurate volume. The volume in the experiment was adjusted by modifying the weight. A total of 400mg of particles of the same size was added every time until 2000mg was reached.

The methods currently used in the paper are mostly electrical capacitance tomography technology and electromagnetic analysis technology. Wenbo Ma of Tianjin University used a tomography technology based on capacitance-sensitive mechanism to display the physical distribution of multiple streams as images by detecting the changes in the capacitance of the array electrodes and reconstructing the image, constructing the image of each phase of the pipeline15. The distribution image can be used to measure the impurity content inside the pipeline. However, this method is only suitable for the detection of metal particles with a large particle size and cannot achieve accurate online detection of fine particles in the pipeline. Li Bin of the Civil Aviation University of China proposed a method for detecting impurities using the internal magnetic field of metals16. The fluctuating voltage of the sensor when the particles pass by is measured. When the millimeter particles pass by the sensor, the current source can be used as the excitation sensor system to output a more ideal useful signal to realize the measurement of impurities. However, this method places the sensor inside the pipeline for detection, and has a higher requirement on the state of the pipeline. When the liquid in the pipeline is in a state of high temperature and high pressure, the magnetic field is greatly disturbed, and this method fails. The method of using positrons for NDT proposed in this paper can address these shortcomings, and directly perform online detection of the impurity content inside the metal pipe outside the pipe.",p,273,ParaText,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,missing,11.0,11.0,0,smissing,missing,missing,missing,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"We have read several papers, and finding a method for detecting the content of impurities in metals is difficult.",3,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Paratext,missing,140,2,0,113,0,0,missing,missing,p,p,missing,span,Paratext,Paratext,missing,Paratext,1.0,3.0,4.0,27.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,ParaText,0.99972636

The experimental results in this paper are largely affected by the sensor error. Thus, a CZT crystal semiconductor sensor will be used to optimize the experimental process in the future work for reducing the maximum error to less than 1%. The proposed detection device can be designed in a small instrument box and constitute a portable instrument. Thus, the proposed method can be powerful for the in-situ and online detection of engine test bench and wear condition of several equipment.
