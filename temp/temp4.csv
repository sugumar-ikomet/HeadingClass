We had observed in our patient population that presence of ‘pathologic’ Q waves (Q wave >40ms in width and >25% of the QRS amplitude) in inferior leads (II, III and aVF) in a WCT correlated with a diagnosis of VT. But comparative accuracy with other well-established algorithms have not been rigorously studied.

Unlike previous studies which compared diagnostic accuracy of algorithms to the final diagnosis obtained using invasive electrophysiology study as gold standard, all patients in our cohort did not undergo electrophysiologic study.17 This may be considered both as a strength and a limitation of the study. In real world, it is difficult to justify the need for an EP study on all cases of WCT. In addition, the diagnosis of WCT can often be reached using other techniques such as vagal maneuvers, adenosine administration, reviewing older ECGs of same patient or simply by the high likelihood in specific clinical scenarios. Our patient selection evaluates a more representative patient population by including patients that are expected to be encountered in real word clinical practice – not just those having had an electrophysiology procedure. The advantage of having a definitive gold standard such as an EP study is counterbalanced by the sampling bias created by this approach. The prevalence of VT that maybe expected from an EP lab would be unsurprisingly be higher than in clinical practice.
